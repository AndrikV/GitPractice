# GitPractice
## Session 1
Here I got acquainted in more detail with  commands and opportunities of Git

Here I logged some important practices.

So first one is first commit to change this file using defaults for commit name and discription.

According to the lesson, I was supposed to create a repository through the console, but I did it through a website. So I ran git clone to try commands of the lesson.

Then I used git status and everything was good. Then I add py-file with class topology. I ran git status and saw a different message. So I ran git add on my file. Then commit and now git status is OK.

Then I decided to feel the Staging Area. So I modify my file and run git status.

Then I added .gitignore and wrote `__pycache__` inside. Then commit gitignore file. Then ran git status and everything was OK.

Then I tried .gitkeep for empty directory.

Then I tried git log.

Then I tried git checkout. When try to push, I find out that I can't push without special token. So I generated one. Then everything was OK.

## Session 2

Tried to checkout by SHA.

Tried to checkout -b name_of_branch.

Tried to use git merge.

I read about rebasing, but did not figure out how to use it yourself.

Tried 'git cherry-pick SHA'. There was some confusings.

Tried git stash.
